# Glim

GlÄ«m (pronounced 'gleem') is a command-line tool and web-server for generating beautiful, dynamic cards for your GitHub repositories.

The name comes from an Old English word meaning a small gleam of light, representing how each card captures the brilliance of your project.

- Built entirely with Rust, generating in <50ms, idling at ~5 MB of memory
- Uses the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to fetch repository data
- Provides image rasterization and encoding to PNG, JPEG, AVIF, WebP, GIF
- Fully tested, built for every major OS and architecture

## Usage

```bash
Usage: glim [OPTIONS] <REPOSITORY>

Arguments:
  <REPOSITORY>  The repository to generate a card for, in the format `owner/repo`

Options:
  -o, --output <OUTPUT>  The output path for the generated card

  -h, --help             Print help
  -V, --version          Print version
